# Alpha Media Marketing Website

This is a static website, designed and built by Dylate for Courtney Scott - owner of the brand [Alpha Media Marketing](www.alphamediamarketing.co).

The website is built with two custom designed HTML pages, styled primarily with [Bootstrap 5](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/). Bootstrap is extended using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). See [style.scss](blob/master/assets/scss/style.scss) for details.

## Deployment

The site is intended to be used with Vercel, but can be deployed a number of different ways.

To get the server up and running, simply run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

or

```bash
npm run start
```
